# Budge-it - Personal Budget Tracker

## Project Overview
Budge-It is a personal budget tracking application that allows users to manage their income, expenses, and purchases through an intuitive, category-based system.

## Current Features

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality
- **Budget Management**
  - Enter your monthly income
  - Create expense categories and expense items within those categories
  - Remove categories and items
  - Edit existing categories and items
  - Real-time balance calculation (Income minus Expenses)
  - Goal setting for savings goals, debt repayment goals, and spending goals
  - Track purchases and categorize purchases with 'spending categories'

- **User Interface**
  - Responsive design (mobile-first)
  - Dark/Light theme toggle
  - Modal-based interactions
  - Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
  - A "three column" design for Expenses, Overview, and Spending
  - Color-coded buttons with icons representing the action and minimal text

  **Reporting & Analytics**
  - Extrapolate savings and debt repayment plans to see when goals will be met
  - Track purchases to see if they exceed or are within spending goals
  - Visualize budget with pie charts and graphs to identify key areas and trends

- **Data Persistence**
  - Local storage for all budget data
  - Automatic save on data changes
  - Data survives browser refreshes

- **Built-in Calculator**
  - Full arithmetic operations (+, -, √ó, √∑)
  - Decimal support
  - Clear and backspace functionality
  - Number formatting with commas
  - Calculation history so you can see the previous values that were calculated

### ‚úÖ Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack
- **State Management**: React useState with localStorage persistence

## Proposed Enhancements

### üéØ High Priority Features

#### 1. Data Management
- [ ] **Data Validation**
  - Enhanced form validation
  - Input sanitization
  - Error handling and user feedback

#### 2. Enhanced Budget Tracking
- [ ] **Date Tracking**
  - Add a date of the month to expense items so you know when they come out
  - Add dates to purchases to report on when they were made
  - Historical data tracking

- [ ] **Budget Goals**
  - Set goals for spending each pay period
  - Set goals for savings over a custom period
  - Set goals for debt repayment based on total owing and how much you can pay each month
  - Budget vs actual comparisons
  - Goal progress tracking for spending, savings and debt repayment

  #### 3. Visualization
- [ ] **Charts and Graphs**
  - Pie charts for expense categories
  - Bar charts for income vs expenses
  - Trend analysis over time
  - Spending patterns visualization

### üé® Medium Priority Features

#### 4. User Experience
- [ ] **Search and Filter**
  - Search and sort purchases by name, spending category, and date
  - Ability to expand and collapse categories for simple and clean visualization
  - In desktop screen sizes, the entire page isn't scrollable. Instead, each column has the CSS property 'overflow: scroll'
  - In tablet and mobile screen sizes, there is just one column and the entire page is scrollable
  - Filters for 'This month' and custom date periods

#### 5. Reporting
- [ ] **Financial Reports**
  - Monthly/yearly summaries
  - Category spending reports
  - Budget variance analysis
  - Printable reports

### üöÄ Low Priority Features

#### 6. Export/Import functionality

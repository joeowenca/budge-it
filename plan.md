# Implementation Plan - Personal Budget Tracker

## Phase 1: Foundation & Database
- [x] **Step 1.1**: Initialize project & install dependencies.
    - Install: `drizzle-orm`, `@neondatabase/serverless`, `dotenv`, `zod`.
    - Install Dev: `drizzle-kit`.
    - **Config**: Enable `{ reactCompiler: true }` in `next.config.ts`.
- [x] **Step 1.2**: Set up Database Client.
    - Create `src/db/drizzle.ts` using `@neondatabase/serverless`.
    - Configure `.env.local` with `DATABASE_URL`.
- [x] **Step 1.3**: Define Schema in `src/db/schema.ts`.
    - `users`: (id, clerkId, email, name, createdAt).
    - `transactions`: (id, amount, description, date, category, type['income', 'expense'], userId, createdAt).
    - `budgets`: (id, category, limit, period, userId).
    - Ensure correct Foreign Key relationships (transactions.userId -> users.id).
- [x] **Step 1.4**: Generate and Push Migrations.
    - Run `npx drizzle-kit generate` and `npx drizzle-kit push`.

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Sync
- [x] **Step 2.1**: Install & Configure Clerk.
    - Install `@clerk/nextjs`.
    - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.local`.
    - Wrap `src/app/layout.tsx` in `<ClerkProvider>`.
    - Create `src/middleware.ts` to protect routes.
- [x] **Step 2.2**: Create the "User Sync" Utility.
    - Create `src/lib/checkUser.ts`.
    - Logic: Get Clerk user -> Check DB for `clerkId` -> If missing, Insert into DB -> Return DB User Object.
- [x] **Step 2.3**: Verify Auth & DB Sync.
    - Create a temporary call in `src/app/page.tsx` to `checkUser()` and log the result to ensure users are being saved to Postgres.

## Phase 3: UI Shell & Navigation
- [x] **Step 3.1**: Initialize Shadcn UI.
    - Run `npx shadcn@latest init`.
    - Add components: `button`, `input`, `label`, `card`, `sheet` (mobile menu), `dialog`, `select`.
- [x] **Step 3.2**: Create App Navbar.
    - Create `src/components/Navbar.tsx` (or Sidebar).
    - Ensure it is responsive.
    - Add a "UserButton" from Clerk.

## Phase 4: Create a responsive layout

- [x] **Step 4.1**: The Responsive Grid Shell.
    - Create `src/app/page.tsx` with the **3-Column Layout** for Desktop:
        - **Col 1:** Budget
        - **Col 2:** Insights
        - **Col 3:** Spending
    -Each column should be its own component stored in `src/components` but rendered on `src/app/page.tsx`
    -Each component/column should have a title, like "Budget", "Insights", and "Spending"
    -There should be a 4th component that spans along the entire top of the page, below the Navbar, and above the 3 columns. This is going to be an overview component.
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Make the layout responsive with a mobile view
    - Reduce the 3-column layout down to 1-column, all components are sorted vertically and you can scroll down them. The top will be the Overview component, then Insights, then Spending, then Budget.

## Phase 5: Budget Component & Transaction Management
*Focus: Turning the "Budget" column into a functional manager using Relational Data.*

- [x] **Step 5.1**: Backend - Database Relations & Actions.
    - **Update Schema**: Edit `src/db/schema.ts` to add `relations`.
        - Define `usersRelations` (one-to-many transactions, one-to-many categories).
        - Define `categoriesRelations` (one-to-many transactions).
        - Define `transactionsRelations` (one-to-one category).
    - Create `src/app/actions/transactionActions.ts`.
    - **Action 1**: `addTransaction(data)`.
        - Logic: Upsert Category (Find existing or Create new) -> Insert Transaction with `categoryId`.
    - **Action 2**: `getBudgetTransactions()`.
        - Query: `db.query.categories.findMany` matching the userId.
        - Options: `with: { transactions: { orderBy: (t, { desc }) => [desc(t.date)] } }`.
        - Result: Returns Categories with their Transactions nested inside, sorted by newest first.

- [x] **Step 5.2**: UI - The "Add Transaction" Dialog.
    - Create `src/components/dashboard/AddTransactionDialog.tsx`.
    - Features:
        - **Tabs** 3 tabs in this order to create the following items: Purchase, Expense, Income
            - **Purchase tab** 
                -Has the following fields:
                    - Category (Combobox: Select existing category with the type "purchase" or create a new category with the type "purchase")
                    - Amount
                    - Date
                    - Memo
                - Used to create a transaction with the type "Purchase" under the selected category
            - **Expense tab** 
                - Has the following fields:
                    - Category (Combobox: Select existing category with the type "expense" or create a new category with the type "expense")
                    - Label
                    - Amount
                    - (No date field yet, will just consider all expenses as monthly)
            - **Income tab** has the following fields:
                - Has the following fields:
                    - Category (Combobox: Select existing category with the type "income" or create a new category with the type "income")
                    - Label
                    - Amount
                    - (No date field yet, will just consider all income as monthly)
        - **Add button** a button at the bottom of the dialog to create the transaction and/or category based on the tab selected and fields completed.
    - Connect to `addTransaction` action.

- [ ] **Step 5.3**: UI - Budget Column Container.
    - [x] **Step 5.3.1** Refactor `src/components/dashboard/Budget.tsx` to remove the 20 placeholder items, and add two new sections:
        - `<BudgetSection title="Income" categories={incomeCategories} />`
        - `<BudgetSection title="Expenses" categories={expenseCategories} />`
    - [x] **Step 5.3.2** Refactor `transactionActions.ts` to have the following functions:
        - addTransaction (already exists)
        - addCategory (already exists)
        - getTransactions (contains filter options for type, categoryId, and dateRange)
        - getCategories (contains a filter option for type)
        - remove getBudgetCategories
    - [x] **Step 5.3.3** Fetch data for the Income and Expense BudgetSection components using `getCategories` (filter for the types Income and Expense to display the correct categories for each section), then within each category, fetch the transactions for each category using `getTransactions` and filtering the results for the corresponding categoryId and type and render them under that category

- [x] **Step 5.4**: UI - collapsible categories
    - Ability to collapse a category so no transactions within the category are visible
    - A collapsed category looks like "CategoryName >    $1234.56" where it's just the category name, a chevron pointing right, and the total amount on the right-side of the line item. 
    - An expanded category looks like "CategoryName v        " where it's just the category name, a chevron point down, and no total amount. Instead, the total is calculated at the bottom below all transactions like a tally sheet.

- [x] **Step 5.5**: UI - Authentication Page (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
    - **UI Layout:**
        - Create a centered layout using a Shadcn `Card` component.
        - Use Shadcn `Tabs` to toggle between "Log In" and "Sign Up" modes.
        - Follow the styling patterns used throughout the app so far
    - **Forms:**
        - Implement `react-hook-form` with `zod` schema validation.
        - **Fields:** Email (valid email format) and Password (min 8 chars, one capital, one number, one special character).
        - **Feedback:** Show inline validation errors and a general error alert if the server action fails.
        - **Loading:** specific `isSubmitting` state on buttons (e.g., "Signing in...").
    - **Integration:**
        - Connect forms to `login` and `signup` actions from `src/app/actions/auth.ts`.
        - Handle successful redirects (handled by server action, but ensure client cleans up state).
- [x] **Step 5.6** Create Budget server actions (`/src/app/actions/budgetActions.ts`)
    - **Action 1** Get all budget categories `getBudgetCategories`
        - Checks that the user is signed in
        - Retrieves all budget categories for the user
        - Accepts options for filtering, like only retrieve the budget categories that have the specified type. See the type definition in `/src/db/schema.ts` in the enum `budgetTypeEnum`.
    - **Action 2** Get all budget items `getBudgetItems`
        - Checks that the user is signed in
        - Retrieves all budget items for the user
        - Accepts options for filtering, like only retrieve the budget items that have the specified type. See the type definition in `/src/db/schema.ts` in the enum `budgetTypeEnum`.
    - **Action 3** Create budget category `createBudgetCategory`
        - Checks that the user is signed in 
        - Checks if that budget category already exists based on userId, type, and name. If those 3 fields match another category, then it already exists. We should return that category.
        - If this budget category doesn't exist, create a new budget category with the following fields based on the budgetCateories schema found in `/src/db/schema.ts`
    - **Action 4** Create budget item `createBudgetItem`
        - Checks that the user is signed in 
        - Create a new budget item with the following fields based on the budgetItems schema found in `/src/db/schema.ts`
- [x] **Step 5.6** Refactor budget front-end to support 'add' actions (`/src/components/dashboard/budget` directory)
    - [x] **Step 5.6.1 - State** Managing the local edit state
        - Each BudgetCategory component will have its own `edit` boolean state. By default, this state will be set to `false`, but if the BudgetCategory contains no BudgetItems, `edit` will be automatically updated to `true`. This check should happen when the component mounts. 
        - Each BudgetItem component (at `/src/components/dashboard/budget/BudgetItem.tsx`) will receive an `edit` prop from the parent BudgetCategory component, so the BudgetItem knows when to go into its edit state.
    - [x] **Step 5.6.2 - Add To Budget dialog**
        - Create `src/components/dashboard/budget/AddToBudgetDialog.tsx`.
            - Features:
                - **Tabs** 3 tabs in this order to create the following items: Expense, Savings, Income
                    - **Expense tab**
                        - Automatically sets the item type to 'Expense' in the backend
                    - **Savings tab**
                        - Automatically sets the item type to 'Savings' in the backend
                    - **Income tab**
                        - Automatically sets the item type to 'Income' in the backend
                    - **Shared fields between the 3 tabs**
                        - All tabs will contain the following fields:
                            - Category (Combobox: Select existing budgetCategory with the type "expense" or create a new budgetCategory with the type "expense"). Uses the server actions in `/src/app/actions/budgetActions.ts` to getBudgetCategories and createBudgetCategories
                            - Name (text input field)
                            - Amount (number input field)
                            - Frequency (4 tabs to select a frequency type: Weekly, Bi-Weekly, Semi-Monthly, Monthly)
                            - Start Date (Calendar date picker that inputs a timestamp)
                            - If the frequency type is Weekly or Bi-Weekly, display the following field:
                                - Day of week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wedesday, Thusday, Friday, Saturday). Can be a drop-down menu field
                            - If the frequency type is Monthly, display the following field:
                                - Day of month (1-31 as a number, or Last which enters in '0' in the backend but displays as 'Last' on the front end)
                            - If the frequency type is Semi-Monthly, display the following fields:
                                - First day of month (1-31 as a number)
                                - Second day of month (1-31 as a number, or Last which enters in '0' in the backend but displays as 'Last' on the front end)
                                - Return an error if the Second day of month is before or equal to the first day of month. They can't match, and second day of the month needs to be > First day of the month unless Second day of the month is set to '0/Last'.
                            - Cancel and Submit buttons in the footer of the dialog pop-up
                - Connect to `/src/app/actions/budgetActions.ts` with the `addBudgetCategory`, `getBudgetCategory` `addBudgetItem` server actions.
- [ ] **Step 5.7** Budget edit state
    - [x] **Step 5.7.1** Update and Delete server actions in `src/app/actions/budgetActions.ts`
        - BudgetCategories and BudgetItems can be updated in the database
        - Deleting a BudgetCategory or BudgetItem doesn't call the delete action yet. Insteadd, it calls the update action and sets the `is_archived` flag to true.
    - [x] **Step 5.7.2** Handling state
        - Ensure archived BudgetCategories and BudgetItems are not rendered (only render if is_archived === false)
        - Add an 'is_editing' boolean state to the BudgetCategory component. Pass it down to all BudgetItem components as a prop. When is_editing is true, the BudgetCategory and all child BudgetItems will then be in the edit state.
    - [x] **Step 5.7.3** Add Category UI
        - Create an '+ Add Category' button that lives by default within each BudgetSection. This button will display below the category list within the BudgetSection component. 
        - Clicking the button will replace the button with 3 fields: emoji, category name, and an add button
        - Filling out the form and adding the category will by default set the category's type based on the section it was added under. For example, if you add a category within the 'Savings' section, the category type will be set to 'savings'.
    - [x] **Step 5.7.4** Budget Item Form component
        - A component that replaces all BudgetItem components within the BudgetCategory component when the BudgetCategory's isEditing state is true. 
        - This component will be a form with the following fields:
            - Name (text)
            - Clickable calendar icon button (no functionality yet)
            - Amount (number) field
            - A delete button
        - All fields will display in-line and should use the same styling as the BudgetItem component. This way, when BudgetCategory's 'isEditing' state is true, the BudgetItemForm components seamlessly replace the BudgetItem components and allow the user to edit their values.
        - When the component renders, the default values for the Name and Amount fields should be the existing values for that budget item from the database. 
        - Submitting the form when addMode is false will utilize the `updateBudgetItem` server action in `budgetActions.ts`. 
    - [x] **Step 5.7.5** Frequency Diaglog UI component
        - [x] **Props:** `open`, `onOpenChange`, `defaultValues`, `onSave`.
        - [x] **Dependencies:** Import existing `DayOfMonthPicker` component.
        - [x] **Form Logic:**
            - [x] **Frequency:** `shadcn` Select.
            - [x] **Start Date:** `shadcn` DatePicker.
            - [x] **Reset Logic:** When Frequency changes, clear/reset values for fields hidden by the new selection (e.g., clear `dayOfWeek` if switching to Monthly, and so on).
        - [x] **Conditional Inputs:**
            - [x] **Weekly/Bi-Weekly:** `shadcn` Select for "Day of Week".
            - [x] **Monthly:**
                - Render one `<DayOfMonthPicker />`.
                - Wire it to update `dayOfMonth` AND `dayOfMonthIsLast`.
            - [x] **Semi-Monthly:**
                - Render **two** `<DayOfMonthPicker />` components (Payment 1, Payment 2).
                - Wire first to `dayOfMonth` / `dayOfMonthIsLast`.
                - Wire second to `secondDayOfMonth` / `secondDayOfMonthIsLast`.
        - [x] **Integration** 
            - Pass item data in, validate with Zod schema, pass data out via `onSave`.
    - [ ] **Step 5.7.6** Integrate FrequencyDialog into BudgetItemForm
        - [ ] Update `BudgetItemForm` props to include `onFrequencyChange: (updates: Partial<z.infer<typeof createBudgetItemSchema>>) => void`.
        - [ ] Add local state `isDialogOpen` to control visibility.
        - [ ] Add `onClick` handler to the Calendar icon wrapper to open dialog.
        - [ ] Create `handleFrequencyChange` function:
            - Receives data from `FrequencyDialog`'s `onSave`.
            - Calls the `onFrequencyChange` prop to update the parent draft.
            - Closes the dialog.
        - [ ] Render `<FrequencyDialog />` at the bottom of the component.
    - [ ] **Step 5.7.7** Integrate Frequency Logic into BudgetCategory
        - [ ] Open `BudgetCategory.tsx`.
        - [ ] **Create Handlers:**
            - `handleItemFrequencyChange(itemId, data)`: Updates `itemEditValues`.
            - `handleNewListItemFrequencyChange(tempId, data)`: Updates a specific item in the `newItems` array.
            - `handleNewInputFrequencyChange(data)`: Updates the `newItem` state (the add row).
        - [ ] **Update JSX:**
            - Pass `onFrequencyChange` to the existing items' `BudgetItemForm`.
            - Pass `onFrequencyChange` to the `newItems` loop `BudgetItemForm`.
            - Pass `onFrequencyChange` to the "Add" mode `BudgetItemForm`.
